# GreenRide - Sustainable Campus Transport Pooling System ## 🌍 Overview GreenRide is a smart, eco-friendly ride-pooling platform designed to reduce campus carbon emissions by connecting students and staff with similar commute routes. The system makes environmental impact visible, measurable, and rewarding. ### The Problem We're Solving **Every morning on campus:** - Hundreds of vehicles arrive, most carrying just one person - Traffic congestion increases - Fuel consumption rises - Carbon emissions grow - Parking becomes scarce - Transportation costs burden students **The impact:** - A typical solo commute of 10 km produces ~1.2 kg of CO₂ - With 1000 solo commuters, that's **1,200 kg of CO₂ daily** - Over an academic year: **~216,000 kg of CO₂** (equivalent to **108 round-trip flights** NYC to LA) ### Our Solution A ride-pooling platform that: - **Connects people** with similar routes automatically - **Makes impact visible** through real-time CO₂ savings - **Builds community** through shared commutes - **Rewards sustainability** with tangible metrics - **Reduces costs** for everyone --- ## ✨ Key Features ### 🎯 Smart Route Matching - Automatic matching based on origin, destination, and timing - 30-minute time window for flexible scheduling - Real-time seat availability tracking - Distance calculation for accurate impact metrics ### 🌱 Environmental Impact Visualization **Individual Impact:** - CO₂ saved per ride displayed prominently - Tree equivalency calculations (1 tree absorbs ~0.06 kg CO₂/day) - Distance traveled without emissions - Personal impact dashboard **Community Impact:** - Total campus CO₂ savings displayed in header - Collective metrics encourage participation - Gamification through visible progress ### 👥 User-Friendly Interface **For Drivers (Ride Offers):** - Quick form to publish ride details - See potential environmental impact before confirming - Track all offered rides in one place - Manage availability and cancellations **For Passengers (Ride Requests):** - Simple search by route and time - Browse available matches with full details - See CO₂ savings for each ride option - Direct contact with drivers ### 📊 Personal Dashboard - Total CO₂ saved across all rides - Number of shared commutes - Tree equivalency metrics - Active ride management ### 🔒 Privacy & Simplicity - No user accounts required - Contact information shared only when needed - localStorage-based persistence - Works offline after first load --- ## 🛠️ Technical Stack ### Frontend - **HTML5** - Semantic structure - **CSS3** - Modern styling with CSS Grid & Flexbox - **Vanilla JavaScript** - No dependencies, pure performance ### Data Storage - **localStorage** - Client-side persistence - **JSON** - Simple data structure - **In-memory cache** - Fast access ### Why This Stack? 1. **Zero Dependencies** - No frameworks = faster, lighter 2. **Works Offline** - After first load, no internet needed 3. **Easy to Deploy** - Just host static files 4. **Easy to Extend** - Clean, modular code 5. **Privacy First** - Everything runs client-side --- ## 📁 Project Structure

Solo Ride CO₂ = Distance (km) × 0.12 kg CO₂/km × Number of Passengers
Pooled Ride CO₂ = Distance (km) × 0.12 kg CO₂/km
CO₂ Saved = Solo Ride CO₂ - Pooled Ride CO₂
**Example:** - Route: City Center → Main Campus (8 km) - Driver + 2 passengers = 3 people - Solo emissions: 8 km × 0.12 × 3 = **2.88 kg CO₂** - Pooled emissions: 8 km × 0.12 × 1 = **0.96 kg CO₂** - **Savings: 1.92 kg CO₂** (67% reduction!) **Tree Equivalency:** - 1 mature tree absorbs ~0.06 kg CO₂ per day - 1.92 kg CO₂ saved = **32 trees** worth of daily absorption ### Route Matching Algorithm
javascript
function findMatchingRides(criteria) {
    return rides.filter(ride => {
        // 1. Same origin and destination
        // 2. Same date
        // 3. Within 30-minute time window
        // 4. Seats available
        // 5. Active status
    });
}
**Matching Criteria:** 1. **Exact route match** - Same start and end points 2. **Date match** - Same day 3. **Time flexibility** - ±30 minutes 4. **Availability** - Seats > 0 5. **Status** - Active rides only --- ## 🎨 Design Philosophy ### 1. Impact First - CO₂ savings are front and center - Every action shows environmental benefit - Numbers are relatable (trees, distance) ### 2. Simplicity Over Complexity - Two main actions: Offer or Find - Minimal form fields - Clear visual hierarchy - No overwhelming choices ### 3. Positive Reinforcement - Celebrate every shared ride - Show cumulative impact - Community achievements visible - Green aesthetics throughout ### 4. Trust & Transparency - See driver details before booking - Direct contact information - Clear route and timing info - Honest impact calculations --- ## 🌍 SDG Alignment ### SDG 13: Climate Action **Target 13.2:** Integrate climate action into policies and planning **Our Contribution:** - Reduces transportation emissions (major CO₂ source) - Makes climate action accessible to students - Provides measurable, trackable impact - Encourages sustainable behavior change **Measurable Outcomes:** - CO₂ reduction per ride - Community-wide emissions savings - Behavior change tracking - Long-term sustainability metrics ### Additional SDG Impacts **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities** - Reduces traffic congestion - Improves urban mobility - Decreases parking demand **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption** - Optimizes resource use (vehicles) - Reduces fuel consumption - Promotes sharing economy **SDG 17: Partnerships** - Builds campus community - Creates social connections - Enables collaborative action --- ## 📊 Impact Metrics ### Environmental Impact - **CO₂ Reduction**: Direct calculation per ride - **Fuel Saved**: Estimated based on distance - **Tree Equivalency**: Relatable environmental metric ### Social Impact - **Connections Made**: Students meeting students - **Cost Savings**: Shared fuel expenses - **Time Efficiency**: Carpool lane access ### Campus Benefits - **Parking Reduction**: Fewer vehicles needed - **Traffic Decrease**: Smoother campus access - **Community Building**: Shared experiences --- ## 🔧 Customization Guide ### Add New Routes Edit script.js:
javascript
const routeDistances = {
    'Your Location-Destination': 15, // km
    // Add more routes
};
### Adjust CO₂ Calculations Modify the constant:
javascript
const CO2_PER_KM_SOLO = 0.12; // kg per km
### Change Time Window Edit the matching function:
javascript
const timeWindow = 30 * 60 * 1000; // milliseconds
### Update Branding CSS variables in styles.css:
css
:root {
    --primary-green: #4CAF50;
    --primary-dark: #388E3C;
    /* Customize colors */
}
