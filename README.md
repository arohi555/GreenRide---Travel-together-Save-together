# GreenRide---Travel-together-Save-together
GreenRide is a sustainable ride-pooling platform built to reduce commute-related carbon emissions on and around campus by matching drivers and riders going the same way. Carpooling reduces the number of vehicles on the road, cuts fuel consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions, and eases traffic congestion while fostering community connections.
