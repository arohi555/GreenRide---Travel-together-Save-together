🚗 GreenRide — Summary

GreenRide is a sustainable ride-pooling platform built to reduce commute-related carbon emissions on and around campus by matching drivers and riders going the same way. Carpooling reduces the number of vehicles on the road, cuts fuel consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions, and eases traffic congestion while fostering community connections.

🌍 The Problem

Single-occupancy vehicle commutes contribute significantly to carbon emissions, air pollution, congestion, and fuel costs.

Shared transportation offers a practical alternative to reduce these negative impacts.

🛠 GreenRide Solution

GreenRide enables:

Drivers to offer rides with route, timing, and seat details.

Riders to find suitable pooled rides based on origin, destination, date, and time.

Smart matching within a 30-minute window to increase ride relevance and participation.

Environmental impact tracking, showing users how much CO₂ they save by pooling.

📊 Core Functionality

Route Matching: Finds ride matches by comparing routes, dates, and timings.

CO₂ Savings: Calculates environmental impact by comparing emissions of solo vs. pooled commuting.

Dashboard: Displays personal and community CO₂ savings and other impact metrics.

🌱 Environmental Impact

Pooling multiple passengers in one car drastically lowers emissions per person compared with private, single-occupant travel.

Carpooling is shown to reduce CO₂ emissions significantly, often by up to 50% or more per passenger mile compared with solo drives.

At larger scales, ride-sharing has demonstrable potential to reduce total transportation emissions by double-digit percentages in various contexts.

💡 Social & Economic Benefits

Cost savings for commuters due to shared fuel expenses.

Reduced traffic congestion and strain on parking infrastructure.

Community building through shared experiences and interactions between riders and drivers.

🖥 Technical Approach

Frontend: HTML, CSS for layout and UI; JavaScript for logic, matching, and dynamic updates.

Storage: Browser localStorage used for persistent ride and impact data without requiring accounts.

Offline-Friendly: Once loaded, the app works without internet access.

🌟 Why It Matters

GreenRide turns daily commutes into measurable climate action — transforming everyday transport into visible sustainability gains while delivering practical benefits like lower costs and stronger campus community engagement.
